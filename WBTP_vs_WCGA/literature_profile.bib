abstract = {Biomarkers have been used to diagnose and prognosticate the progress and outcome of many chronic diseases such as neoplastic and non communicable diseases. However, only recently did the field of malaria research move in the direction of actively identifying biomarkers that can accurately discriminate the severe forms of malaria. Malaria continues to be a deadly disease, killing close to a million people (mostly children) every year. One life-threatening complication of malaria is cerebral malaria (CM). Studies carried out in Africa have demonstrated that even with the best treatment, as high as 15–30% of CM patients die and about 10–24% of CM survivors suffer short-or long-term neurological impairment. The transition from mild malaria to CM can be sudden and requires immediate intervention. Currently, there is no biological test available to confirm the diagnosis of CM and its complications. It is hoped that development of biomarkers to identify CM patients and potential risk for adverse outcomes would greatly enhance better intervention and clinical management to improve the outcomes. We review here what is currently known regarding biomarkers for CM outcomes. A Pub Med literature search was performed using the following search terms: “malaria,” “cerebral malaria,” “biomarkers,” “mortality” and “neurological sequelae.” This search revealed a paucity of usable biomarkers for CM management. We propose three main areas in which researchers can attempt to identify CM biomarkers: 1) early biomarkers, 2) diagnostic biomarkers and 3) prognostic biomarkers.},

abstract = {Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening complication of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, and it claims around two million lives a year, mainly those of children in sub-Saharan Africa. A number of works, particularly in murine models of CM, showed that several mediators are involved in the development of the disease, including monocytes, T lymphocytes, cytokines, chemokines, platelets, nitric oxide scavengers and heme, among others, but a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of this complication is still lacking. This overview critically analyzes and discusses the definition, clinical features, neurocognitive outcomes and pathogenesis of human CM. We focused on the relationship between clinical and laboratory features and the diagnosis and prognosis of the complication showing indicators of poor prognosis and emphasizing the need of establishing predictive scores to estimate, on admission, the likelihood of any malarial patient to develop neurological complications. The potential development of a mathematical model for early prediction of CM through neurological assessment using the SHIRPA protocol in Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected susceptible mice is shown. High positive predictive values (>89%) on days 5 and 6 of infection, observed for some generated SHIRPA scores, indicate the possibility of early detection of mice with a high probability of developing CM.},

abstract = {Malaria affects millions of people around the world and a small subset of those infected develop cerebral malaria. The clinical presentation of cerebral malaria differs between children and adults, and it has been suggested that age-related changes in the endothelial response may account for some of these differences. During cerebral malaria, parasites sequester within the brain microvasculature but do not penetrate into the brain parenchyma and yet, the infection causes severe neurological symptoms. Endothelial dysfunction is thought to play an important role in mediating these adverse clinical outcomes. During infection, the endothelium becomes activated and more permeable, which leads to increased inflammation, hemorrhages, and edema in the surrounding tissue. We hypothesize that post-natal developmental changes, occurring in both endothelial response and the neurovascular unit, account for the differences observed in the clinical presentations of cerebral malaria in children compared with adults.},

Adjunctive therapy targeting the underlying pathophysiology of cerebral malaria may further improve the clinical outcome. Endothelial activation and dysfunction is a central process in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. An improved understanding of how endothelium is perturbed in cerebral malaria may yield novel strategies to diagnose and intervene. Here, we discuss recent findings on the key molecular mediators of endothelial activation/dysregulation in cerebral malaria, and innovative endothelial-based experimental approaches to improve detection and treatment. Recent findingsBiomarkers of endothelial activation [e.g., angiopoietin (Ang)-1, Ang-2, and a soluble form of the Ang-receptor (soluble Tie-2)] have been shown to be reliable predictors of malarial disease severity and mortality, and may improve clinical triage and management. Moreover, they may represent novel therapeutic targets to improve clinical outcome. Restoring bioavailable nitric oxide by administration of inhaled nitric oxide or its substrate, L-arginine, may rescue endothelial function, decrease Ang-2, and improve disease outcome in cerebral malaria. SummaryInterventions targeting the Ang–Tie-2 axis to promote endothelial quiescence, including agents to improve endothelial nitric oxide, represent potential adjunctive therapies for cerebral malaria.},

Studies in mouse malaria infection models have shown that CXCL10 blockade alleviates brain intravascular inflammation and protects infected mice from CM. Despite the key role that CXCL10 plays in the development of CM, the leucocytic sources of CXCL10 in response to human malaria are not known. Here we investigated CXCL10 responses to Plasmodium falciparum in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We found that PBMCs from malaria-unexposed donors produce CXCL10 in response to P. falciparum and that this response is IFN-γ-dependent. Moreover, CD14+ monocytes were identified as the main leucocytic sources of CXCL10 in peripheral blood, suggesting an important role for innate immune responses in the activation of this pathway involved in the development of symptomatic malaria.},

This study aimed at identifying the molecule of nHZ lipid moiety that was responsible for these effects. Results showed that 15-HETE mimicked nHZ effects on lysozyme release, whereas 4-HNE did not. 15-HETE-enhanced lysozyme release was abrogated by anti-TNF-α and anti-IL-1β-blocking antibodies and mimicked by recombinant cytokines; on the contrary, MIP-1α/CCL3 was not involved as a soluble mediator of 15-HETE effects. Moreover, 15-HETE early activated p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways by inducing p38 MAPK phosphorylation; cytosolic I-κBα phosphorylation and degradation; NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA-binding. Inhibition of both routes through chemical inhibitors (SB203580, quercetin, artemisinin, and parthenolide) prevented 15-HETE-dependent lysozyme release. Collectively, these data suggest that 15-HETE plays a major role in nHZ-enhanced monocyte degranulation.},

abstract = {Objective:To investigate the relationship among the angiopoietin–Tie-2 system, retinopathy, and mortality in children with cerebral malaria. Design:A case–control study of retinopathy-positive vs. retinopathy-negative children with clinically defined cerebral malaria. Setting:Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Subjects:One hundred fifty-five children presenting with severe malaria and meeting a strict definition of clinical cerebral malaria (Blantyre Coma Score ⩽2, Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia, no other identifiable cause for coma) were included in the study. Interventions:None. Measurements and Main Results:Clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded at admission and funduscopic examinations were performed. Admission levels of angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and a soluble version of their cognate receptor were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We show that angiopoietin-1 levels are decreased and angiopoietin-2 and soluble Tie-2 levels are increased in children with cerebral malaria who had retinopathy compared with those who did not. Angiopoietin-2 and soluble Tie-2 were independent predictors of retinopathy (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], angiopoietin-2, 4.3 [1.3–14.6], p = .019; soluble Tie-2, 9.7 [2.1–45.8], p = .004). Angiopoietin-2 and soluble Tie-2 were positively correlated with the number of hemorrhages, the severity or retinal whitening, and the extent of capillary whitening observed on funduscopic examination (p < .05 after adjustment for multiple comparisons). Angiopoietin-2 and soluble Tie-2 levels were elevated in children with cerebral malaria who subsequently died and angiopoetin-2 was an independent predictor of death (adjusted odds ratio: 3.9 [1.2–12.7], p = .024). When combined with clinical parameters, angiopoetin-2 improved prediction of mortality using logistic regression models and classification trees. Conclusions:These results provide insights into mechanisms of endothelial activation in cerebral malaria and indicate that the angiopoietin–Tie-2 axis is associated with retinopathy and mortality in pediatric cerebral malaria.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Cerebral malaria (CM) is one of the most severe forms of P. falciparum infection, with an associated high case-fatality rate. Angiopoietins (ANG‐1 and ANG‐2) are important biomarkers of endothelial activation and dysfunction. This study was carried out in Maharani Hospital and associated Medical College, Jagdalpur, CG, Central India from 2010 to 2014. Based on the treatment recovery patterns, cases (n = 65) were classified as mild malaria with rapid recovery (MM-RR), n= 14; non-cerebral severe malaria with moderately fast recovery (NCSM‐MFR), n= 9; CM survivors with slow recovery (CMS-SR), n= 36 and deteriorated CM non-survivors (Det‐CMNS), n= 6. Plasma levels (pg/ml) of ANG-1 and ANG-2 were measured by ELISA in all the samples at the time of hospital admission and 48 hours of treatment. Levels were also measured in available samples at the third time point (time of discharge for survivors or 72 hours post-treatment in fatal cases). Data analysis was done by appropriate statistical tests using Stata 11.0 and SPSS 25.0 software. At the time of admission, ANG-2 and ratios of ANG-2/ANG-1 significantly distinguished Det‐CMNS cases from MM-RR and NCSM‐MFR cases with good AUC scores (0.8‐0.9). Further, Det-CMNS cases could also be distinguished from MM-RR, NCSM-MFR, and CMS-SR cases by ANG-2 (AUC scores 0.9) and ratios of ANG‐2/ANG-1 (AUC: 0.8‐0.9) at 48 hours of treatment. Paired analysis of sequential measurement of angiopoietins revealed that compared to admission levels, the ratios of ANG-2/ANG-1 significantly declined 48 hours after treatment in MM-RR (p= 0.041), NCSM-MFR (p= 0.050), and CMS-SR (p= 0.0002) cases but not in cases of Det-CMNS (p= 0.916). In conclusion, plasma levels of ANG-2 and ratios of ANG-2/ANG-1 may serve as good biomarkers to distinguish the malaria severity at the time of hospital admission and recovery patterns upon treatment in Central India},

abstract = {The risk factors for cerebral malaria (CM) and the wide variation in clinical manifestations of malaria are poorly understood. Recent studies indicate that interferon gamma inducible chemokine, CXCL10, is a strong predictor of both human and experimental cerebral malaria. Increased plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of CXCL10 were tightly associated with fatal CM in Indian and Ghanaian patients. In the present study, we hypothesized that in a subset of malaria patients, CM susceptibility is associated with variation in CXCL10 expression. We determined whether polymorphisms in the CXCL10 gene promoter region played a role in the clinical status of malaria patients and addressed the genetic basis of CXCL10 expression during malaria infection. Following extensive bioinformatics analyses, two reported single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CXCL10 promoter (−135G>A [rs56061981] and −1447A>G [rs4508917]) were identified among 66 CM and 69 non-CM Indian patients using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Individuals with the −1447(A/G) genotype were susceptible to CM (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.51–5.85, p = 0.021). In addition, individuals with the −1447(A/G) genotype had significantly higher plasma CXCL10 levels than individuals with the −1447(A/A) genotype. Stratifying patients according to gender, the observed association of CM with over expression of CXCL10 were more pronounced in males than in female patients (AOR = 5.47, 95% CI = 1.34–22.29, p = 0.018). Furthermore, −135G>A polymorphism conferred a decreased risk of CM among males (AOR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.05–0.78, p = 0.021). Polymorphisms in the CXCL10 gene promoter sequence were associated with increased CXCL10 production, which is linked to severity of CM. These results suggest that the −1447A>G polymorphism in CXCL10 gene promoter could be partly responsible for the reported variation underlying severity of CM outcomes particularly in males.},

The precise mechanisms underlying lymphocyte recruitment and activation in CM remain unclear. Therefore, the expression of various chemokines was quantified in brains of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA). Several chemokines attracting monocytes and activated T‐lymphocytes were expressed at high levels. Their expression was almost completely abrogated in IFN‐γ ligand and receptor KO mice, indicating that IFN‐γ is an essential chemokine inducer in vivo. Surprisingly, the expression levels of chemokines, IFN‐γ and also adhesion molecules in the brain were not lower in CM‐resistant Balb/c and DBA/2 mice compared to CM‐sensitive C57BL/6 and DBA/1 mice, although T lymphocyte sequestration in the brain was significantly less in CM‐resistant than in CM‐sensitive mice. This difference correlated with a higher up‐regulation of the CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)‐3 on splenic T cells and a higher chemotactic response to IFN‐γ‐inducible protein‐10 (IP‐10) in C57BL/6 compared to Balb/c mice. In conclusion, parasite‐induced IFN‐γ in the brain results in high local expression levels of specific chemokines for monocytes and lymphocytes. The strain‐dependent susceptibility to develop CM is more related to the expression of CXCR3 in circulating leukocytes than to the chemokine expression levels in the brain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
In children with cerebral malaria (CM), serum chemokine levels and associated morbidity and mortality have not been characterized.


METHODS
Serum levels of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta , IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured in Ugandan children with CM, in children with uncomplicated malaria (UM), and in healthy children from the community, as control subjects (CCs).


RESULTS
Children with CM had lower levels of RANTES and higher levels of all other cytokines and chemokines than CCs (all P<.0001), and they had lower levels of RANTES (P=.004) and higher levels of IL-10 (P=.003), IFN-gamma (P=.007), and IL-1 beta (P=.05) than children with UM. Children with CM who died had lower levels of RANTES (P=.006) and higher of levels of IL-6 (P=.006), IL-10 (P=.01), IFN-gamma (P=.03), and MIP-1 beta (P=.008) than children who survived. After adjustment for other cytokine and chemokine levels, only low levels of RANTES were independently associated with mortality (P=.016). Levels of RANTES correlated with platelet count but were associated with mortality independently of platelet count.


CONCLUSIONS
The serum cytokine and chemokine profile of children who die of CM is similar to that of individuals who die of sepsis. Levels of RANTES are significantly lower in children with CM, and very low levels of RANTES are associated with mortality, independently of other cytokine and chemokine levels.},

abstract = {Despite appropriate anti-malarial treatment, cerebral malaria (CM)-associated mortalities remain as high as 30%. Thus, adjunctive therapies are urgently needed to prevent or reduce such mortalities. Overproduction of CXCL10 in a subset of CM patients has been shown to be tightly associated with fatal human CM. Mice with deleted CXCL10 gene are partially protected against experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) mortality indicating the importance of CXCL10 in the pathogenesis of CM. However, the direct effect of increased CXCL10 production on brain cells is unknown. We assessed apoptotic effects of CXCL10 on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBVECs) and neuroglia cells in vitro. We tested the hypothesis that reducing overexpression of CXCL10 with a synthetic drug during CM pathogenesis will increase survival and reduce mortality. We utilized atorvastatin, a widely used synthetic blood cholesterol-lowering drug that specifically targets and reduces plasma CXCL10 levels in humans, to determine the effects of atorvastatin and artemether combination therapy on murine ECM outcome. We assessed effects of atorvastatin treatment on immune determinants of severity, survival, and parasitemia in ECM mice receiving a combination therapy from onset of ECM (day 6 through 9 post-infection) and compared results with controls. The results indicate that CXCL10 induces apoptosis in HBVECs and neuroglia cells in a dose-dependent manner suggesting that increased levels of CXCL10 in CM patients may play a role in vasculopathy, neuropathogenesis, and brain injury during CM pathogenesis. Treatment of ECM in mice with atorvastatin significantly reduced systemic and brain inflammation by reducing the levels of the anti-angiogenic and apoptotic factor (CXCL10) and increasing angiogenic factor (VEGF) production. Treatment with a combination of atorvastatin and artemether improved survival (100%) when compared with artemether monotherapy (70%), p<0.05. Thus, adjunctively reducing CXCL10 levels and inflammation by atorvastatin treatment during anti-malarial therapy may represent a novel approach to treating CM patients.},

abstract = {BackgroundPlasmodium falciparum in a subset of patients can lead to cerebral malaria (CM), a major contributor to malaria-associated mortality. Despite treatment, CM mortality can be as high as 30%, while 10% of survivors of the disease may experience short- and long-term neurological complications. The pathogenesis of CM is mediated by alterations in cytokine and chemokine homeostasis, inflammation as well as vascular injury and repair processes although their roles are not fully understood. The hypothesis for this study is that CM-induced changes in inflammatory, apoptotic and angiogenic factors mediate severity of CM and that their identification will enable development of new prognostic markers and adjunctive therapies for preventing CM mortalities.MethodsPlasma samples (133) were obtained from healthy controls (HC, 25), mild malaria (MM, 48), cerebral malaria survivors (CMS, 48), and cerebral malaria non-survivors (CMNS, 12) at admission to the hospital in Jabalpur, India. Plasma levels of 30 biomarkers ((IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, Eotaxin, FGF basic protein, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1 (MCAF), MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, TNF-α, Fas-ligand (Fas-L), soluble Fas (sFas), soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNF-R1) and soluble TNF receptor 2 (sTNFR-2), PDGF bb and VEGF)) were simultaneously measured in an initial subset of ten samples from each group. Only those biomarkers which showed significant differences in the pilot analysis were chosen for testing on all remaining samples. The results were then compared between the four groups to determine their role in CM severity.ResultsIP-10, sTNF-R2 and sFas were independently associated with increased risk of CM associated mortality. CMNS patients had a significantly lower level of the neuroprotective factor VEGF when compared to other groups (P < 0.0045). The ratios of VEGF to IP-10, sTNF-R2, and sFas distinguished CM survivors from non survivors (P < 0.0001).ConclusionThe results suggest that plasma levels of IP-10, sTNF-R2 and sFas may be potential biomarkers of CM severity and mortality. VEGF was found to be protective against CM associated mortality and may be considered for adjunctive therapy to improve the treatment outcome in CM patients.},

abstract = {Abstract Cerebral malaria (CM) is the major lethal complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection. It is characterized by persistent coma along with symmetrical motor signs. Several clinical, histopathological, and laboratory studies have suggested that cytoadherence of parasitized erythrocytes, neural injury by malarial toxin, and excessive inflammatory cytokine production are possible pathogenic mechanisms. Although the detailed pathophysiology of CM remains unsolved, it is thought that the binding of parasitized erythrocytes to the cerebral endothelia of microvessels, leading to their occlusion and the consequent angiogenic dysregulation play a key role in the disease pathogenesis. Recent evidences showed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor-related molecules are over-expressed in the brain tissues of CM patients, as well as increased levels of VEGF are detectable in biologic samples from malaria patients. Whether the modulation of VEGF is causative agent of CM mortality or a specific phenotype of patients with susceptibility to fatal CM needs further evaluation. Currently, there is no biological test available to confirm the diagnosis of CM and its complications. It is hoped that development of biomarkers to identify patients and potential risk for adverse outcomes would greatly enhance better intervention and clinical management to improve the outcomes. We review and discuss here what it is currently known in regard to the role of VEGF in CM as well as VEGF as a potential biomarker.},

abstract = {BackgroundPlasmodium falciparum can cause a diffuse encephalopathy known as cerebral malaria (CM), a major contributor to malaria associated mortality. Despite treatment, mortality due to CM can be as high as 30% while 10% of survivors of the disease may experience short- and long-term neurological complications. The pathogenesis of CM and other forms of severe malaria is multi-factorial and appear to involve cytokine and chemokine homeostasis, inflammation and vascular injury/repair. Identification of prognostic markers that can predict CM severity will enable development of better intervention.MethodsPostmortem serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained within 2–4 hours of death in Ghanaian children dying of CM, severe malarial anemia (SMA), and non-malarial (NM) causes. Serum and CSF levels of 36 different biomarkers (IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, Eotaxin, FGF basic protein, CRP, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IP-10, MCP-1 (MCAF), MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, SDF-1α, CXCL11 (I-TAC), Fas-ligand [Fas-L], soluble Fas [sFas], sTNF-R1 (p55), sTNF-R2 (p75), MMP-9, TGF-β1, PDGF bb and VEGF) were measured and the results compared between the 3 groups.ResultsAfter Bonferroni adjustment for other biomarkers, IP-10 was the only serum biomarker independently associated with CM mortality when compared to SMA and NM deaths. Eight CSF biomarkers (IL-1ra, IL-8, IP-10, PDGFbb, MIP-1β, Fas-L, sTNF-R1, and sTNF-R2) were significantly elevated in CM mortality group when compared to SMA and NM deaths. Additionally, CSF IP-10/PDGFbb median ratio was statistically significantly higher in the CM group compared to SMA and NM groups.ConclusionThe parasite-induced local cerebral dysregulation in the production of IP-10, 1L-8, MIP-1β, PDGFbb, IL-1ra, Fas-L, sTNF-R1, and sTNF-R2 may be involved in CM neuropathology, and their immunoassay may have potential utility in predicting mortality in CM.},

abstract = {BackgroundThe mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria (CM) syndrome are not well understood. Previous studies have shown a strong association of inflammatory chemokines, apoptotic markers and angiogenic molecules with CM associated mortality. Recognizing the importance of angiopoietins (ANG) in the pathogenesis of CM, a retrospective investigation was carried out in a hospital cohort of malaria patients with Plasmodium infection in central India to determine if these factors could be suitable markers of CM associated severity.MethodsPatients enrolled in the study were clinically characterized as healthy controls (HC), mild malaria (MM), CM survivors (CMS) and CM non-survivors (CMNS) based on their malaria status and hospital treatment outcome. Plasma ANG-1 and ANG-2 levels were assessed using sandwich ELISA. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to calculate area under the curve (AUC) for each biomarker in order to assess predictive accuracy of individual biomarkers.ResultsThe plasma levels of ANG-1 were lower in CMS and CMNS compared to control groups (mild malaria and healthy controls) at the time of hospital admission. On the contrary, ANG-2 levels positively correlated with malaria severity and were significantly higher in CMNS. The ratio of ANG-2/ANG-1 was highest in CMNS compared to other groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that compared to ANG-1 (AUC = 0.35), ANG-2 (AUC = 0.95) and ratio of ANG-2/ANG-1 (AUC = 0.90) were better markers to discriminate CMNS from MM cases. However, they were less specific in predicting fatal outcome amongst CM cases at the time of hospital admission.ConclusionThese results suggest that at the time of admission plasma levels of ANG-2 and ratio of ANG-2/ANG-1 are clinically informative biomarkers to predict fatal CM from MM cases while they have limited usefulness in discriminating fatal CM outcomes in a pool of CM cases in endemic settings of Central India.},

The pathogenesis of CM involves vascular inflammation, immune stimulation, and obstruction of cerebral capillaries. Platelets have a prominent role in both immune responses and vascular obstruction. We now demonstrate that the platelet-derived chemokine, platelet factor 4 (PF4)/CXCL4, promotes the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). Plasmodium-infected red blood cells (RBCs) activated platelets independently of vascular effects, resulting in increased plasma PF4. PF4 or chemokine receptor CXCR3 null mice had less severe ECM, including decreased T cell recruitment to the brain, and platelet depletion or aspirin treatment reduced the development of ECM. We conclude that Plasmodium-infected RBCs can directly activate platelets, and platelet-derived PF4 then contributes to immune activation and T cell trafficking as part of the pathogenesis of ECM.},

abstract = {BackgroundPlasma angiopoietin (Ang)-2 is associated with disease severity and mortality in adults and children with falciparum malaria. However the mechanism of action of the angiopoietins in fatal malaria is unclear. This study aimed to determine whether the expression of Ang-1 and Ang-2 and their receptor Tie-2 in cerebral endothelial or parenchymal cells was specific to cerebral malaria (CM), correlated with coma or other severe clinical features, and whether plasma and CSF levels of these markers correlated with the clinical and neuropathological features of severe and fatal malaria in Vietnamese adults.MethodsImmunohistochemistry was performed for Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 on post-mortem brain tissue from fatal malaria cases and controls. Quantitative ELISA for plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 was done to compare fatal cases with surviving patients from the same study.ResultsImmunohistochemistry revealed significant differences in expression in endothelial and parenchymal cells compared to controls. However there was no significant difference in expression of these markers on endothelial cells, astroglial cells or neurons between CM and non-cerebral malaria cases. Immunostaining of Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 was also not associated with Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocyte sequestration in the brain. However Ang-1 and Ang-2 expression in neurons was significantly correlated with the incidence of microscopic haemorrhages. Plasma levels of Ang-2 and Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio were associated with the number of severe malaria complications and were significant and independent predictors of metabolic acidosis and fatal outcome.ConclusionsThe independent prognostic significance of Ang-2 and the Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio in severe malaria was confirmed, although immunohistochemistry in fatal cases did not reveal increased expression on brain endothelium in cerebral versus non-cerebral cases. Activation of the Ang-Tie-2 pathway in severe malaria is therefore related to acidosis, number of severity criteria and outcome, but is not a specific event in the brain during cerebral malaria.},

This suggests that strategies directed solely at parasite eradication may be insufficient to prevent neurological complications and death in all cases of CM. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop innovative adjunctive therapeutic strategies to effectively reduce CM-associated mortality.

abstract = {Background Severe malaria is a leading cause of childhood mortality in Africa. However, at presentation, it is difficult to predict which children with severe malaria are at greatest risk of death. Dysregulated host inflammatory responses and endothelial activation play central roles in severe malaria pathogenesis. We hypothesized that biomarkers of these processes would accurately predict outcome among children with severe malaria. Methodology/Findings Plasma was obtained from children with uncomplicated malaria (n = 53), cerebral malaria (n = 44) and severe malarial anemia (n = 59) at time of presentation to hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Levels of angiopoietin-2, von Willebrand Factor (vWF), vWF propeptide, soluble P-selectin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), soluble endoglin, soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1), soluble Tie-2, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, 10 kDa interferon gamma-induced protein (IP-10), and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) were determined by ELISA. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess predictive accuracy of individual biomarkers. Six biomarkers (angiopoietin-2, soluble ICAM-1, soluble Flt-1, procalcitonin, IP-10, soluble TREM-1) discriminated well between children who survived severe malaria infection and those who subsequently died (area under ROC curve>0.7). Combinational approaches were applied in an attempt to improve accuracy. A biomarker score was developed based on dichotomization and summation of the six biomarkers, resulting in 95.7% (95% CI: 78.1–99.9) sensitivity and 88.8% (79.7–94.7) specificity for predicting death. Similar predictive accuracy was achieved with models comprised of 3 biomarkers. Classification tree analysis generated a 3-marker model with 100% sensitivity and 92.5% specificity (cross-validated misclassification rate: 15.4%, standard error 4.9%). Conclusions We identified novel host biomarkers of pediatric severe and fatal malaria (soluble TREM-1 and soluble Flt-1) and generated simple biomarker combinations that accurately predicted death in an African pediatric population. While requiring validation in further studies, these results suggest the utility of combinatorial biomarker strategies as prognostic tests for severe malaria.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum malaria is responsible for over 250 million clinical cases every year worldwide. Severe malaria cases might present with a range of disease syndromes including acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycaemia, renal failure, anaemia, pulmonary oedema, cerebral malaria (CM) and placental malaria (PM) in pregnant women. Two main determinants of severe malaria have been identified: sequestration of parasitized red blood cells and strong pro-inflammatory responses. Increasing evidence from human studies and malaria infection animal models revealed the presence of host leucocytes at the site of parasite sequestration in brain blood vessels as well as placental tissue in complicated malaria cases. These observations suggested that apart from secreting cytokines, leucocytes might also contribute to disease by migrating to the site of parasite sequestration thereby exacerbating organ-specific inflammation. This evidence attracted substantial interest in identifying trafficking pathways by which inflammatory leucocytes are recruited to target organs during severe malaria syndromes. Chemo-attractant cytokines or chemokines are the key regulators of leucocyte trafficking and their potential contribution to disease has recently received considerable attention. This review summarizes the main findings to date, investigating the role of chemokines in severe malaria and the implication of these responses for the induction of pathogenesis and immunity to infection.},

The pathogenesis of this disease remains incompletely understood. Chemokines have been implicated in the development of cerebral malaria, and the IFN-inducible CXCR3 chemokine ligand IP-10 (CXCL10) was recently found to be the only serum biomarker that predicted cerebral malaria mortality in Ghanaian children. We show that the CXCR3 chemokine ligands IP-10 and Mig (CXCL9) were highly induced in the brains of mice with murine cerebral malaria caused by Plasmodium berghei ANKA. Mice deficient in CXCR3 were markedly protected against cerebral malaria and had far fewer T cells in the brain compared with wild-type mice. In competitive transfer experiments, CXCR3-deficient CD8+ T cells were 7-fold less efficient at migrating into the infected brains than wild-type CD8+ T cells. Adoptive transfer of wild-type CD8+ effector T cells restored susceptibility of CXCR3-deficient mice to cerebral malaria and also restored brain proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and recruitment of T cells, independent of CXCR3. Mice deficient in IP-10 or Mig were both partially protected against cerebral malaria mortality when infected with P. berghei ANKA. Brain immunohistochemistry revealed Mig staining of endothelial cells, whereas IP-10 staining was mainly found in neurons. These data demonstrate that CXCR3 on CD8+ T cells is required for T cell recruitment into the brain and the development of murine cerebral malaria and suggest that the CXCR3 ligands Mig and IP-10 play distinct, nonredundant roles in the pathogenesis of this disease.},

The objective of this study was to assess serum biomarkers that differentiate between CM and non-CM, with the long-term goal of developing a clinically informative prognostic test for severe malaria. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on the hypothesis that endothelial activation and blood-brain-barrier dysfunction contribute to CM pathogenesis, we examined the endothelial regulators, angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1) and angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), in serum samples from P. falciparum-infected patients with uncomplicated malaria (UM) or CM, from two diverse populations – Thai adults and Ugandan children. Angiopoietin levels were compared to tumour necrosis factor (TNF). In both populations, ANG-1 levels were significantly decreased and ANG-2 levels were significantly increased in CM versus UM and healthy controls (p<0.001). TNF was significantly elevated in CM in the Thai adult population (p<0.001), but did not discriminate well between CM and UM in African children. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that ANG-1 and the ratio of ANG-2∶ANG-1 accurately discriminated CM patients from UM in both populations. Applied as a diagnostic test, ANG-1 had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for distinguishing CM from UM in Thai adults and 70% and 75%, respectively, for Ugandan children. Across both populations the likelihood ratio of CM given a positive test (ANG-1<15 ng/mL) was 4.1 (2.7–6.5) and the likelihood ratio of CM given a negative test was 0.29 (0.20–0.42). Moreover, low ANG-1 levels at presentation predicted subsequent mortality in children with CM (p = 0.027). Conclusions/Significance ANG-1 and the ANG-2/1 ratio are promising clinically informative biomarkers for CM. Additional studies should address their utility as prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in severe malaria.},

abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum malaria causes 660 million clinical cases with over 2 million deaths each year. Acquired host immunity limits the clinical impact of malaria infection and provides protection against parasite replication. Experimental evidence indicates that cell-mediated immune responses also result in detrimental inflammation and contribute to severe disease induction. In both humans and mice, the spleen is a crucial organ involved in blood stage malaria clearance, while organ-specific disease appears to be associated with sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in vascular beds and subsequent recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes. Using a rodent model of cerebral malaria, we have previously found that the majority of T lymphocytes in intravascular infiltrates of cerebral malaria-affected mice express the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Here we investigated the effect of IP-10 blockade in the development of experimental cerebral malaria and the induction of splenic anti-parasite immunity. We found that specific neutralization of IP-10 over the course of infection and genetic deletion of this chemokine in knockout mice reduces cerebral intravascular inflammation and is sufficient to protect P. berghei ANKA-infected mice from fatality. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that lack of IP-10 during infection significantly reduces peripheral parasitemia. The increased resistance to infection observed in the absence of IP-10-mediated cell trafficking was associated with retention and subsequent expansion of parasite-specific T cells in spleens of infected animals, which appears to be advantageous for the control of parasite burden. Thus, our results demonstrate that modulating homing of cellular immune responses to malaria is critical for reaching a balance between protective immunity and immunopathogenesis.},

Surviving patients have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, behavioral difficulties, and epilepsy making cerebral malaria a leading cause of childhood neurodisability in the region. The pathogenesis of neurocognitive sequelae is poorly understood: coma develops through multiple mechanisms and there may be several mechanisms of brain injury. It is unclear how an intravascular parasite causes such brain injury. Understanding these mechanisms is important to develop appropriate neuroprotective interventions. This article examines possible mechanisms of brain injury in cerebral malaria, relating this to the pathogenesis of the disease, and explores prospects for improved neurocognitive outcome.},

abstract = {Background. Host responses to infection are critical determinants of disease severity and clinical outcome. The development of tools to risk stratify children with malaria is needed to identify children most likely to benefit from targeted interventions. Methods. This study investigated the kinetics of candidate biomarkers of mortality associated with endothelial activation and dysfunction (angiopoietin-2 [Ang-2], soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1 [sFlt-1], and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [sICAM-1]) and inflammation (10 kDa interferon γ-induced protein [CXCL10/IP-10] and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 [sTREM-1]) in the context of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial evaluating inhaled nitric oxide versus placebo as adjunctive therapy to parenteral artesunate for severe malaria. One hundred eighty children aged 1–10 years were enrolled at Jinja Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda and followed for up to 6 months. Results. There were no differences between the 2 study arms in the rate of biomarker recovery. Median levels of Ang-2, CXCL10, and sFlt-1 were higher at admission in children who died in-hospital (n = 15 of 180; P < .001, P = .027, and P = .004, respectively). Elevated levels of Ang-2, sTREM-1, CXCL10, and sICAM-1 were associated with prolonged clinical recovery times in survivors. The Ang-2 levels were also associated with postdischarge mortality (P < .0001). No biomarkers were associated with neurodisability. Conclusions. Persistent endothelial activation and dysfunction predict survival in children admitted with severe malaria.},

abstract = {The severity of malaria is multi-factorial. It is associated with parasite-induced alteration in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in host serum and cerebrospinal fluid. It is also associated with sequestration and cytoadherence of parasitized erythrocytes (pRBCs) in post-capillary venules and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. The role of these factors in development of vascular injury and tissue damage in malaria patients is unclear. While some studies indicate a requirement for pRBC adhesion to vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in brain capillaries to induce apoptosis and BBB damage, others show no role of apoptosis resulting from adhesion of pRBC to EC. In the present study, the hypothesis that soluble factors from Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes induce apoptosis in human brain vascular endothelial (HBVEC) and neuroglia cells (cellular components of the BBB) was tested. Apoptotic effects of parasitized (pRBC) and non-parasitized erythrocyte (RBC) conditioned medium on HBVEC and neuroglia cells were determined in vitro by evaluating nuclear DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay) in cultured cells. Soluble factors from P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes in conditioned medium induced extensive DNA fragmentation in both cell lines, albeit to a greater extent in HBVEC than neuroglia, indicating that extended exposure to high levels of these soluble factors in serum may be associated with vascular, neuronal and tissue injury in malaria patients.},

abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum in a subset of patients can lead to a diffuse encephalopathy known as cerebral malaria (CM). Despite treatment, mortality caused by CM can be as high as 30% while 10% of survivors of the disease may experience short- and long-term neurological complications. The pathogenesis of CM involves alterations in cytokine and chemokine expression, local inflammation, vascular injury and repair processes. These diverse factors have limited the rate of discovery of prognostic predictors of fatal CM. Identification of reliable early predictors of CM severity will enable clinicians to adjust this risk with appropriate management of CM. Recent studies revealed that elevated levels of CXCL10 expression in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood plasma independently predicted severe and fatal CM. CXCR3, a promiscuous receptor of CXCL10, plays an important role in pathogenesis of mouse model of CM. In this study the role of corresponding CXCR3 ligands (CXCL11, CXCL10, CXCL9 & CXCL4) in fatal or severe CM was evaluated by comparing their levels in 16 healthy control (HC), 26 mild malaria (MM), 26 cerebral malaria survivors (CMS) and 12 non-survivors (CMNS) using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Levels of CXCL4 and CXCL10 were significantly elevated in CMNS patients (p < 0.05) when compared with HC, MM and CMS. Elevated plasma levels of CXCL10 and CXCL4 were tightly associated with CM mortality. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that CXCL4 and CXCL10 can discriminate CMNS from MM (p < 0.0001) and CMS (p < 0.0001) with an area under the curve (AUC) = 1. These results suggest that CXCL4 and CXCL10 play a prominent role in pathogenesis of CM associated death and may be used as functional or surrogate biomarkers for predicting CM severity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Plasmodium vivax is the most widely distributed human malaria parasite with an at risk population of 2.5 billion persons. With the implementation of molecular diagnosis, it has become evident that P. vivax monoinfection could also result in multiple organ dysfunction and severe life-threatening disease as seen in P. falciparum infection.


AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To note the clinical profile of patients with severe vivax malaria with regards to demographic, clinical and biochemical profile and its outcome. To compare the profile of falciparum malaria with vivax malaria.


METHOD AND MATERIAL
We recruited 711 patients fulfilling the criteria for severe malaria during the study period from June 2010 to Jan 2011. Detailed history and examination findings were noted in all the patients. All the patients were subjected to routine haematological and biochemical investigations. The end points were discharge from wards or death due to malaria.


RESULTS
We had 711 patients with severe malaria of which 488 (68.53%) patients had severe vivax and 223 (31.32%) had severe falciparum malaria. Amongst vivax group, 351 (71.92%) were males and 137 (28.07%) females. Thrombocytopenia (89.13%) was the most common complication followed by renal (31.96%), hepatic (19.46%) cerebral (8.19%) and pulmonary (1.63%) involvement. Most patients were in the age group of 21-30 years and mortality increased with increasing age. The mortality observed in severe vivax malaria was 9.01% (44/488), as compared to falciparum malaria where it was 16.14% (80/223).


CONCLUSIONS
Severe vivax malaria is now very common with increasing mortality. The mortality in vivax malaria increases with increasing age. Thrombocytopenia is very common in severe vivax infection. Also, renal, hepatic, lung and cerebral involvement are also occur with increasing frequency. Along with age, severe metabolic acidosis is an independent risk factor for fatal outcome.},

abstract = {BackgroundSevere and cerebral malaria are associated with endothelial activation. Angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1) and angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) are major regulators of endothelial activation and integrity. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical utility of whole blood angiopoietin (ANG) levels as biomarkers of disease severity in Plasmodium falciparum malaria.MethodsThe utility of whole blood ANG levels was examined in Thai patients to distinguish cerebral (CM; n = 87) and severe (non-cerebral) malaria (SM; n = 36) from uncomplicated malaria (UM; n = 70). Comparative statistics are reported using a non-parametric univariate analysis (Kruskal-Wallis test or Chi-squared test, as appropriate). Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to examine differences in whole blood protein levels between groups (UM, SM, CM), adjusting for differences due to ethnicity, age, parasitaemia and sex. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the ANGs in their ability to distinguish between UM, SM and CM. Cumulative organ injury scores were obtained for patients with severe disease based on the presence of acute renal failure, jaundice, severe anaemia, circulatory collapse or coma.ResultsANG-1 and ANG-2 were readily detectable in whole blood. Compared to UM there were significant decreases in ANG-1 (p < 0.001) and significant increases in ANG-2 (p < 0.001) levels and the ratio of ANG-2: ANG-1 (p < 0.001) observed in patients with SM and CM. This effect was independent of covariates (ethnicity, age, parasitaemia, sex). Further, there was a significant decrease in ANG-1 levels in patients with SM (non-cerebral) versus CM (p < 0.001). In participants with severe disease, ANG-2, but not ANG-1, levels correlated with cumulative organ injury scores; however, ANG-1 correlated with the presence of renal dysfunction and coma. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the level of ANG-1, the level of ANG-2 or the ratio of ANG-2: ANG-1 discriminated between individuals with UM and SM (area under the curve, p-value: ANG-2, 0.763, p < 0.001; ANG-1, 0.884, p < 0.001; Ratio, 0.857, p < 0.001) or UM and CM (area under the curve, p-value: ANG-2, 0.772, p < 0.001; ANG-1, 0.778, p < 0.001; Ratio, 0.820, p < 0.001).ConclusionsThese results suggest that whole blood ANG-1/2 levels are promising clinically informative biomarkers of disease severity in malarial syndromes.},

abstract = {Cerebral malaria (CM) can be a fatal manifestation of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Using murine models of malaria, we found much greater up-regulation of a number of chemokine mRNAs, including those for CXCR3 and its ligands, in the brain during fatal murine CM (FMCM) than in a model of non-CM. Expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 RNA was localized predominantly to the cerebral microvessels and in adjacent glial cells, while expression of CCL5 was restricted mainly to infiltrating lymphocytes. The majority of mice deficient in CXCR3 were found to be protected from FMCM, and this protection was associated with a reduction in the number of CD8+ T cells in brain vessels as well as reduced expression of perforin and FasL mRNA. Adoptive transfer of CD8+ cells from C57BL/6 mice with FMCM abrogated this protection in CXCR3−/− mice. Moreover, there were decreased mRNA levels for the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and lymphotoxin-α in the brains of mice protected from FMCM. These data suggest a role for CXCR3 in the pathogenesis of FMCM through the recruitment and activation of pathogenic CD8+ T cells.},

Primary therapy with quinine or artesunate is generally effective in controlling P. falciparum parasitemia, but mortality from cerebral malaria and other forms of severe malaria remains unacceptably high. Long-term cognitive impairment is also common in children with cerebral malaria. Of the numerous adjunctive therapies for cerebral malaria and severe malaria studied over the past five decades, only one (albumin) was associated with a reduction in mortality. In this article, we review past and ongoing studies of adjunctive therapy, and examine the evidence of efficacy for newer therapies, including inhibitors of cytoadherence (e.g., levamisole), immune modulators (e.g., rosiglitazone), agents that increase nitric oxide levels (e.g., arginine) and neuroprotective agents (e.g., erythropoietin).},

abstract = {Background Differentiating cerebral malaria (CM) from other causes of serious illness in African children is problematic, owing to the non-specific nature of the clinical presentation and the high prevalence of incidental parasitaemia. CM is associated with endothelial activation. In this study we tested the hypothesis that endothelium-derived biomarkers are associated with the pathophysiology of severe malaria and may help identify children with CM. Methods and Findings Plasma samples were tested from children recruited with uncomplicated malaria (UM; n = 32), cerebral malaria with retinopathy (CM-R; n = 38), clinically defined CM without retinopathy (CM-N; n = 29), or non-malaria febrile illness with decreased consciousness (CNS; n = 24). Admission levels of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Ang-1, soluble Tie-2 (sTie-2), von Willebrand factor (VWF), its propeptide (VWFpp), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) and interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) were measured by ELISA. Children with CM-R had significantly higher median levels of Ang-2, Ang-2:Ang-1, sTie-2, VWFpp and sICAM-1 compared to children with CM-N. Children with CM-R had significantly lower median levels of Ang-1 and higher median concentrations of Ang-2:Ang-1, sTie-2, VWF, VWFpp, VEGF and sICAM-1 compared to UM, and significantly lower median levels of Ang-1 and higher median levels of Ang-2, Ang-2:Ang-1, VWF and VWFpp compared to children with fever and altered consciousness due to other causes. Ang-1 was the best discriminator between UM and CM-R and between CNS and CM-R (areas under the ROC curve of 0.96 and 0.93, respectively). A comparison of biomarker levels in CM-R between admission and recovery showed uniform increases in Ang-1 levels, suggesting this biomarker may have utility in monitoring clinical response. Conclusions These results suggest that endothelial proteins are informative biomarkers of malarial disease severity. These results require validation in prospective studies to confirm that this group of biomarkers improves the diagnostic accuracy of CM from similar conditions causing fever and altered consciousness.},

abstract = {Adherence of parasitized erythrocytes to activated endothelium causes microvascular obstruction, tissue ischemia, and clinical complications in severe malaria (SM); however, the mechanisms leading to endothelial activation remain unclear. The angiogenic factors, angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are modulators of endothelial activation, with Ang-2 release from Weibel–Palade bodies (WPBs) being regulated by endothelial nitric oxide (NO). We explored the relationships between endothelial NO bioavailability, Ang-2, VEGF, tissue perfusion, and clinical outcomes in SM. We measured plasma Ang-2 and VEGF, together with biomarkers of severity from 146 adults with and without SM, in parallel with longitudinal measures of endothelial function by using reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (a measure of endothelial NO bioavailability). Regression was used to relate concentrations of Ang-2/VEGF with malaria disease severity, biomarkers of perfusion, endothelial activation, and parasite biomass. The longitudinal relationship between Ang-2 and endothelial function was assessed by using a mixed-effects model. Ang-2 concentrations were elevated in SM and associated with increased venous lactate, plasma intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 concentrations, parasite biomass, and mortality. In contrast, VEGF concentrations were inversely associated with these biomarkers. Ang-2 concentrations were significantly better predictors of death than venous lactate (P = 0.03). Recovery of endothelial function was associated with falling concentrations of Ang-2. Ang-2 release from endothelial cells with reduced NO bioavailability is likely to contribute to endothelial activation, sequestered parasite biomass, impaired perfusion, and poor outcome in severe falciparum malaria. Agents that improve endothelial NO, reduce WPB exocytosis, and/or antagonize Ang-2 may have therapeutic roles in SM.},

abstract = {Severe malaria is commonly misdiagnosed in Africa, leading to a failure to treat other life-threatening illnesses. In malaria-endemic areas, parasitemia does not ensure a diagnosis of severe malaria because parasitemia can be incidental to other concurrent disease. The detection of malarial retinopathy is a candidate diagnostic test for cerebral malaria. Malarial retinopathy consists of a set of retinal abnormalities that is unique to severe malaria and common in children with cerebral malaria. Its presence and severity are related to risk of death and length of coma in survivors. A large, prospective autopsy study of children dying with cerebral malaria in Malawi found that malarial retinopathy was better than any other clinical or laboratory feature in distinguishing malarial from non-malarial coma. However, visualization has to date relied on specialist examination techniques. Further studies are planned to evaluate the usefulness of funduscopy by general clinicians in a variety of settings across Africa.
